# Welcome to the Backend for WePlan!

My name is Jimmy Zheng and this is my Final Project that I have/am developing for the Awesome Inc Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. It is a display of all the skills that I have accumulated in my time spent here at Awesome Inc. I thoroughly enjoyed all the challenges that I faced navigating through all the stages of development starting with finding an issue I'm passionate about in society that I thought could have a better solution. The next was outlining all of the little details needed for my project's MVP. Finally the biggest challenge of all was bringing together my knowledge of backend and frontend to create a structurally sound application that also emphasizes a clean UX/UI.
